Working on build a tool that converts an IP address to a domain name

# What is an IP address
Essentially, all computers on the internet are connected in some way. Now they can communicate whether wireless or via cable. Say for example Computrer A want to get a web page from the intenet, well in order for this transaction to take place, the computer A needs to have what is called an IP address, so that it can be located. IP address is short for Internet protocl address.

An IP address is just a string of numbers written in a space format. An example is something like 192.155.12.1
Here each in the set is from 0 t0 255 range or we can say that a full IP address ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
These IP address are assigned by IANA (Known as Internet corporation For the Intern Assigned Numbers Authority)

Now the intenet protcl os a set of rules that makes the internet works. For example within a web page you are able to read the content beacuse your device has a unique address where the page that you requested (to read the particular webpage) was successufully delivered

[That is just eh basic]

# How does an IP address gets converted to a domain name
An IP address is a unique numerical lable assigned to each devices connected to a computer network that uses the internet protocl for communication. An IP address server two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing
IP addresses are conventionally written and displayed in human-readable notation, such as 172.16.254.1 in IPv4 and 2001:db8:0:1234:0:567:8:1 in IPv6. The dot-decimal notation is only used for IPv4 addresses, For IPv6, colons are used to group hexadecimal words into octets

Domain names are used to identify one or more IP addresses. For example, the domainname microsoft.com represents about a dozen IP addresses.
Domain names are used in URLS to identify particular web pages. For exaple, the URL http://www.pcwebopedia.com/index.html, the domain name is pcwbopedia.com

Every domain name has a suffix that indicates whihc top level domain (TLD) it belongs to. There are only a limited number of such domains
